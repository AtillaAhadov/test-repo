# Test task for a job interview

This app shows the intersection of the x a user tries to find and the y of the item that the program finds respectively. 
The intersection is shown by a black circle with an y on it.
The background is devided by three horisontal white lines each of which is called "Hello World" (that was a part of the interview task).
When you click on the graph, it navigates you to the same graph, except there is no text field to find the intersection.
For this project I used 'days' as x axis and 'score' as y axis.
I only used a small array of items for the demonstration purposes.
